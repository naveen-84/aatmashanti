          <p>Meditation is a process of lightening up, of trusting the basic goodness of what we have and who we are, 
            and of realizing that any wisdom that exists, exists in what we already have. 
            We can lead our life so as to become more awake to who we are and 
            what we are doing rather than trying to improve or change or get rid of who we are or what we are doing. 
            The key is to wake up, to become more alert, more inquisitive and curious about ourselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <p>Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
          <p>Meditation will not carry you to another world, but it will reveal the most profound and awesome dimensions 
            of the world in which you already live. Calmly contemplating these dimensions and bringing them into the service 
            of compassion and kindness is the right way to make rapid gains in meditation as well as in life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <p>Touch your inner space, which is nothingness, as silent and empty as the sky; it is your inner sky. Once you settle down in your
             inner sky, you have come home, and a great maturity arises in your actions, in your behavior. Then whatever you do  has grace in it. 
             Then whatever you do is a poetry in itself. You live poetry; your walking becomes dancing, your silence becomes music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <p>The mind is madness. Only when you go beyond the mind, will there be Meditation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <p>Meditation means dissolving the invisible walls that unawareness has built.</p>
